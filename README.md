## Overview

Terminal File Manager is a Java-based virtual file system simulation that provides a command-line interface for managing files and directories. It mimics the basic functionality of a real file system, allowing users to practice and learn common terminal commands in a safe, controlled environment.

The program represents the file system as a tree structure of nodes, where each node can be a file or a folder. The `FileManager` class manages the current directory context using a stack and supports navigation and modification of the file system through commands such as:

- **`cd`**: Change the current directory, supporting navigation to subfolders, the parent directory (`..`), or the root.
- **`ls`**: List contents of the current directory, with optional alphabetical sorting.
- **`pwd`**: Print the full path of the current working directory.
- **`mkdir`**: Create new folders inside the current directory.
- **`touch`**: Create new files in the current directory.
- **`delete`**: Remove files or folders from the current directory.
- **`find`**: Search recursively from the current directory for a file or folder by name.
- **`stats`**: Display statistics about the file system, including total files, folders, and maximum directory depth.
- **`help`**: Provide usage information for all commands or a specific command.

The file system hierarchy is built using the `FileSystemNode` class, which differentiates files and folders and stores children nodes for folders. The application also supports basic command validation and outputs helpful messages for invalid operations or inputs.

The programâ€™s modular design allows easy extension by adding new commands or modifying the file system structure. It provides a useful tool for those learning terminal commands, file system navigation, and basic file operations without interacting with the real file system.
